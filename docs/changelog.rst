0.11.0
******

0.11.0 is the biggest change so far to CMake Tools. It brings not just new
functionality, but new infrastructure and maintainers behind the extension.

It began with an `overly-ceremonious blog post <https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2017/12/15/cmt-1.0-and-beta.html>`_,
followed by months of beta (when it should have been a few weeks).

Here's a quick summary:

- :ref:`"Kits" provide a new way to encapsulate the toolset used to build a
  project. <kits>`
- Opt-in automatic error reporting.
- Lots of stability and backend cleanup.
- All new documentation!

0.10.x and Older
****************

The old (pre-0.11.0) changelog can be found in `here <https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.pre-0.11.0.md>`_.
