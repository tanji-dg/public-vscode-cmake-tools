Getting Started
###############

Assuming you already have a CMake project to configure, skip to the
:ref:`configuring` section.

.. _configuring:

Configuring Your Project
************************

Configuring a project is simple, but has two steps before configuration can take
place.

Pre-Configure Steps
===================

Selecting a Kit
---------------

Before we can configure, you must select a *Kit*.

What are kits?
    Kits represent a *toolchain*: A set of compilers, linkers, or other tools
    that will be used to build a project. If you have no Kit selected, CMake
    Tools will start by asking you to select a Kit.

When first opening a project, a status bar item will read **No Kit Selected**:

.. image:: res/no_kits.png
    :align: center

To select a kit, click this statusbar button, or run the *Select a Kit* command
from the command palette. A quick-pick will appear:

.. image:: res/kit_selector.png
    :align: center

Upon choosing a kit, the statusbar button will display the name of the active
kit:

.. image:: res/kit_selected.png
    :align: center

The chosen kit will be remembered between sessions. Should the availability of
the kit change, the statusbar item may revert and you will be required to select
a kit again.

.. note::
    If you try to configure your project without an active Kit selected, you
    will be prompted to choose one before configuring can proceed.

CMake Tools will use the compilers/toolchain from the kit when building your
project.

Find out more on the :ref:`kits` page.

Selecting a Variant
-------------------

Similar to selecting a kit, we must select a *Variant*.

What are variants?
    Variants represent a set of common compilation options that change the type
    of binaries that will be emitted. This includes Debug, Release, MinSizeRel,
    etc.

.. image:: res/no_variant.png
    :align: center

To select a variant, click this statusbar button, or run the *Set build type*
command from the command palette. A quick-pick will appear:

.. image:: res/variant_selector.png
    :align: center

The active build variant will be displayed on the same statusbar button, along
with the project name and extension status.

Find out more on the :ref:`variants` page.

Running Configuration
=====================

Configuration can be run by clicking the project button in the statusbar and
changing the build type, by running the *CMake: Configure* command from the
command palette, or by running a build when configuration has not yet taken
place.

When configuration runs, the *CMake/Build* output panel will reveal and show
the live output from CMake as configuration runs:

.. image:: res/configure_output.png
    :align: center

At this point, CMake Tools has loaded information about your project and you are
free to roam about the cabin.


Building Your Project
*********************

More important than just configuring, you probably want to *build* your project
as well.

Building is simple: Run the *CMake: Build* command from the command palette:

.. image:: res/build_command.png
    :align: center

.. note:: The default keybinding for this command is ``F7``.

You can also press the *Build* button in the statusbar:

.. image:: res/build_button.png
    :align: center

While the the build is running, the *Build* button will be replaced with a
build progress bar:

.. image:: res/build_progress.png
    :align: center

The build can be stopped by clicking the *Stop* button.
