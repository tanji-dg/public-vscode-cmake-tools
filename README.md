# VSCode CMake Tools

This is a simple Visual Studio Code extension that offers CMake integration. This extension
itself *does not* provide language support. For that I recommend
[this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake).

This extension can be installed with ``ext install cmake-tools``.
