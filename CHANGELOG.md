# What's New?

[Also check the changelog in the end-user documentation](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/docs/vscode-cmake-tools/changelog.html).

**0.11.1** includes several [fixes and tweaks](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-cmake-tools/milestone/7?closed=1).

The **0.11.0** release marks a monumental change for this project. Besides
overhauling the development and testing process, three particular things are
most notable to users:

- [Thorough end-user documentation](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/docs/vscode-cmake-tools/)
  is now available.
- CMake Tools includes automated opt-in error-report sending. The first time
  you load CMake Tools it will ask your permission to send error and exception
  data to Rollbar for cataloging and triage.
- CMake Tools now has the concept of *Kits* to represent how to build your
  project. [Read more in the new documentation](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/docs/vscode-cmake-tools/kits.html).
